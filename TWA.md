### Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

All members will be expected to read Slack messages from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than **24 hours** unless there is an emergency. However, it is preferred for members to read and respond to messages by the end of the day this message was sent.


### Scheduling Meetings

Meetings will be regularly scheduled on the first Tueday and the last Thursday of a sprint, for Sprint Planning and Sprint Restrospective and Review, respectively. If any emergency meetings are to be scheduled, these meetings must be communicated to team members at least 12 hours in advance. The Scrum Master will ask at the beginning of each week if any team members wants to raise any concerns they have to the rest of the team. If there are any issues raised by the team, then these issues will be discussed on the Thursday of that week. 


#### General Responsibilities for all Team Members

- To behave professionally toward other group members and course staff
- To respect and listen to the other team members
- Have patience, compassion, and understanding for others throughout the project
- To complete assigned responsibilities for the project in a timely fashion, and to "pull their weight" with the project
- To keep other members updated of the work they are doing
- To keep an open and honest line of communication with the course staff and members of the group. _Let the team or course staff know if any issues arise, as soon as they arise_
- When asking other team members for help, be specific about what went wrong and what the expected behavior is. Team members are expected to spend time attempting to resolve issues themselves before asking for help.
- Write descriptive documentation for all aspects of your contributions (i.e. the code you write, pull requests, issues) with precise English


#### Conflict Resolution
If a team member is not able to complete their story(s) for any reason, the team will hold a discussion to determine what to do with the story(s) assigned to this team member. There are two options, the first of which is preferred:
- Redistribute roles so that another member can instead complete the task
- Omit completing the task and save it for a future sprint, or drop the task altogether from the project

The factors to consider when making this decision depends on the value to be added by this story(s), its story points, and the time remaining before a sprint ends. _As a team, we should still deliver the value that we promised to our stakeholders. If a team member fails to deliver, we fail to deliver._


#### Definition of Done
A user story is considered to be 'done' when the code for the story has been written and thoroughly tested via unit and acceptance tests. This code must be checked into the repository and reviewed by the Scrum Master.


#### Expectations for Sprint Retrospectives
The Scrum Master will facilitate the Sprint Retrospective ceremony. Among other things, the restrospective will assess the team's thoughts on the following questions:
- _What do you think we as a team (or Scrum Master/Product Owner) did well for this sprint?_
- _What do you think we as a team (or Scrum Master/Product Owner) can improve on for this sprint?_
- _What do you wish we as a team (or Scrum Master/Product Owner) did for this sprint?_

Based on the feedback received, decisions will be made regarding how the next sprint is approached by the team. It is imperative that all team members show up to the retrospective and contribute feedback to all questions asked by the Scrum Master, to ensure quality reflection.


#### Expectations of TA and Instructor

**If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the course staff, _but the team will still be responsible for delivering the stories_.**
